Collaborative photo album sharing for families

This service is still in active development and unreleased to the public as of yet. You can view the dev/test environment at https://shadowboxxdevtest.b4a.app
(This environment is severely rate-limited though, so don't be surprised if some things lag/time-out)

If you'd like to contribute, please create/comment on an issue you'd like to solve. It's just me at the moment, so organization is a bit rough.
